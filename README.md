# redBoard-Tied
Eagle Project to tie together redundant pins of the Sparkfun Quadstepper Motor Driver Board (the Red Board). When UNO Robotics first used the Red Board,
we realized quickly that we did not need all the pins available on the board. We wanted to save space on our Arduino, so we began to solder connections as pictured below.
After Sparkfun retired the Red Board, we were interested to see that they had left their designs open to the public. We wondered if we could continue making our own Red Boards while iterating on their design.
This project attempted to tie together the pins on the board that we used to solder by hand.

The first prototype failed in spectacular fashion as pictured below. We ordered our Red Board design from MacroFab with 1oz copper while Sparkfun's original design demanded 2oz copper. Because our prototpye had half as much copper as it needed, it could not handle the current, heated up quickly, and caught fire.

UNO Robotics has decided to put this project on hold due to the high cost of 2oz copper board fabrication and because the University of New Orleans has acquired its own PCB fabrication machine. As we improve in-house PCB fabrication ability, we intend to come back to the RedBoard project.
